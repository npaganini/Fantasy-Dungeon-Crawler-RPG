# Tri-Force Dungeon Fantasy RPG

## How to play

The **objective** of the game is to defeat the final boss of the dungeon. To do so, you'll need to open all the doors of the dungeon, which can only be open by collecting all the rusted keys distributed across the place. Collecting all the keys in the dungeon will allow you to open the door to the final boss.

### Keyboard Mappings

### Types

There are 3 types of damage that work like a "rock, paper, scissors" game, with each one being stronger against one, and weaker against another. This translates into increased or reduced damage dealt!
- MAGIC is good against MELEE
- MELEE is good against RANGED
- RANGED is good against MAGIC

## UI

Last but not least, you start with a full health bar that regenerates health if you manage to stay outside of combat for a while. Dying will bring you back to the main menu. As for the timer, it works as a highscore system, where the faster you finish the game, the better.

> **Note**: while exploring the dungeon you can always hit `ESC` to pause the game and adjust the volume!
